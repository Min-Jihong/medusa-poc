In this chapter, you'll learn about the types Medusa automatically generates under the `.medusa` directory and how you should use them.

## What are Automatically Generated Types?

Medusa automatically generates TypeScript types for:

1. Data models collected in the [Query's graph](../module-links/query/page.mdx#querying-the-graph). These types provide you with auto-completion and type checking when using Query.
    - Generated data model types are located in the `.medusa/types/query-entry-points.d.ts` file.
2. Modules registered in the [Medusa container](../medusa-container/page.mdx). These types provide you with auto-completion and type checking when resolving modules from the container.
    - Generated module registration names are located in the `.medusa/types/modules-bindings.d.ts` file.

## How to Trigger Type Generation?

The Medusa application generates these types automatically when you run the application with the `dev` command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

So, if you add a new data model or module and you don't find it in auto-completion or type checking, you can run the `dev` command to regenerate the types.

## How to Use the Generated Types?

The generated types are only meant for auto-completion and type checking.

For example, consider you have a Brand Module with a `Brand` data model. Due to the auto-generated types, you can do the following:

<CodeTabs group="auto-generated-types">
  <CodeTab value="query" label="Query">

```ts
const { data: [brand] } = await query.graph({
  entity: "brand",
  fields: ["*"],
  filters: {
    id: "brand_123",
  },
})

// brands has the correct type, so you can access its properties with auto-completion and type checking
console.log(brand.name)
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab value="container" label="Container">

```ts
const brandModuleService = req.scope.resolve("brand")

// brandModuleService has the correct type, so you can access its methods with auto-completion and type checking
const brand = await brandModuleService.retrieveBrand("brand_123")
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

### Don't Import the Generated Types

The generated types are only meant to help you in your development process by providing auto-completion and type checking. You should not import them directly in your code.

Since you don't commit the `.medusa` directory to your version control system or your production environment, importing these types may lead to build errors.

Instead, if you need to use a data model's type in your customizations, you can use the [InferTypeOf](../data-models/infer-type/page.mdx) utility function, which infers the type of a data model based on its properties.

For example, if you want to use the `Brand` data model's type in your customizations, you can do the following:

```ts
import { InferTypeOf } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { Brand } from "../modules/brand/models/brand" // relative path to the model

export type BrandType = InferTypeOf<typeof Brand>
```

You can then use the `BrandType` type in your customizations, such as in workflow inputs or service method outputs.
